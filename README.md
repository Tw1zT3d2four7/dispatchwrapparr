## ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Usage

- `-i`: Required input URL
- `-ua`: Required user agent string
- `-proxy <proxy server>`: Optional: Configure a proxy server. Supports http, https only.
- `-proxybypass <comma-delimited hostnames>`: Optional. To be used in conjunction with `-proxy` directive. Supply a comma-delimited list of hostnames to be bypassed from supplied proxy. Wildcards supported.
- `-clearkeys <clearkey file or url>`: Optional: Supply a json file or URL containing json URL to clearkey mappings.
- `-cookies <cookie file>`: Optional: Supply a cookies txt file in Mozilla/Netscape format for us with streams.
- `-novariantcheck`: Optional: Skips checks for streams containing video or audio only. Will not force muxing of missing audio or video. Cannot be used with -novideo or -noaudio arguments.
- `-novideo`: Optional: Designates the stream as containing no video. Forces muxing of blank video into the stream if it is not detected during variant checking automatically.
- `-noaudio`: Optional: Designates the stream as containing no audio. Forces muxing of silent audio into the stream if it is not detected during variant checking automatically.

## ‚ú® How can I play DASHDRM streams?

Easy! There are two methods, the first of which is the most simple for starting out.

***Method 1: Append a #clearkey=<clearkey> fragment to the stream URL***

You'll need the clearkeys in order to play DRM protected content. There are a number of ways to acquire the keys such as scripts and browser plugins.
This script assumes that you have these keys already.

To play these streams, simply create a custom m3u8 file that places the #clearkey=<clearkey> fragment at the end of the stream URL. Below is an example that could be used for Channel 4 (UK):

```channel-4-uk.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 group-title="United Kingdom" channel-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-logo="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tv-logo/tv-logos/main/countries/united-kingdom/channel-4-uk.png", Channel 4
https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd#clearkey=5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a
```

More channels can be added to the same m3u8 file, and may also contain a mixture of DRM and non-DRM encrypted streams.
Simply upload your m3u8 file into Dispatcharr and select dispatchwrapparr as the profile for any streams.

The `#clearkey=<clearkey>` can also be used in conjunction with other fragments. Eg: `https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd#referer=https://www.channel4.com&clearkey=5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a`

**Note:** If you are to use this option, be sure to remove the 'URL' item from the 'M3U Hash Key' setting. This can be found in 'Settings' -> 'Stream Settings' in Dispatcharr.

<img width="170" height="71" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abbc4b6f-f878-44b3-906b-b0981df105e4" />

The reason why we remove the URL from the hash settings is because if the clearkey ever has to change (many channels rotate theirs regularly), then Dispatcharr won't treat the channel as new.


***Method 2: Use `-clearkeys` argument to supply a json file or URL containing URL to Clearkey mappings***

The `-clearkeys` argument can be supplied with a json formatted file or URL containing URL's which map to clearkeys, and performs this function in the following ways:

- Wildcards are supported. Eg. to match a clearkey to a specific URL, you can specify wildcards in the URL string. Eg. `https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/*/live/channel(c4)/*.mpd`
- When a URL is supplied, it will ignore the `-proxy` directive for fetching clearkeys. It assumes that a proxy is not required for this request. This allows you to create your own clearkeys API that runs locally.
- When a file is supplied without an absolute path, it will assume that the file is in the same directory as the script. Eg. `-clearkeys clearkeys.json` would resolve to `/data/dispatchwrapparr/clearkeys.json`.
- Supports KID:KEY combinations, and comma delimited lists of clearkeys where multiple keys are required.
- If no stream URL matches a clearkey, the script will continue processing the stream as normal.

Below is an example of a `clearkeys.json` file or an expected output from an API/URL containing clearkeys. Again, below is an example that could be used for Channel 4 (UK):

```clearkeys.json
{
  "https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd": "5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a",
}

```

## ‚ú® Can I use custom headers?

Yes, however at this time only 'Referer' and 'Origin' headers are supported.

To use a 'Referer' header, simply append the `#referer=<URL>` fragment to the end of the strean URL.

For both 'Referer' and 'Origin' headers, simply append the `#referer=<URL>&origin=<URL>` fragments together, delimited by an ampersand '&'.

The `#referer=<URL>` fragment can also be used in conjunction with other fragments such as `#clearkey=<clearkey>` if needed.

If required, more custom headers could be added later. If you have a good use-case for this, please feel free to log a feature request.


## ‚ú® Automated Stream Variant Detection

Plex/Emby/Jellyfin expects to receive both video and audio in any streams that it plays. If a stream contains one without the other, they generally won't play.

Dispatchwrapparr will attempt to autodetect if a stream contains only audio, or only video as part of its stream variant checking.

To disable auto-detection of audio-only and video-only streams, the `-novariantcheck` flag may be used in a custom profile or the `#novariantcheck=true` url fragment.

### Audio-only streams (Eg. Streaming Radio)

If the stream is detected to have only audio, then dispatchwrapparr will mux blank video data into the stream so that it can be played.

If autodetection does not work as expected, there are two methods by which you can force the muxing of blank video into the stream.

***Method 1: Use the `-novideo` argument in a custom profile***

The `-novideo` argument can be supplied to dispatchwrapparr as a custom profile for radio station streams.

Using a streaming profile means that you could import manifests of radio streams from various sources and have them all treated as radio stations.

***Method 2: Append `#novideo=true` to the end of the stream URL***

This option works similarly to the other fragment options. In an m3u8 file, simply append a `#novideo=true` fragment to the end of the stream URL, and dispatchwrapparr will treat it as a radio station.

Below is an example of a custom m3u8 manifest with Channel X from New Zealand, and the `#novideo=true` fragment appended.

```channel-x.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="Radio.Channel.X" group-title="Radio" tvg-logo="https://images.mediaworks.nz/rova/Content/apps/images/ChannelX_600x600.png",Channel X
https://mediaworks.streamguys1.com/chx_net/playlist.m3u8#novideo=true
```

### Video-only streams (Eg. Live Cameras)

If the stream is detected to have only video, then dispatchwrapparr will mux silent audio into the stream so that it can be played.

If autodetection does not work as expected, there are two methods by which you can force the muxing of silent audio into the stream.

***Method 1: Append `#noaudio=true` fragment to the stream URL***

In an m3u8 file, simply append a `#noaudio=true` fragment to the end of the stream URL, and dispatchwrapparr will generate dummy audio for the stream.

Below is an example of a custom m3u8 manifest with the SEN 4K Livestream from the International Space Station with multiple fragments including `#noaudio=true` appended.

```sen-iss.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="ISS.SEN.4K" group-title="Miscellaneous" tvg-logo="https://about.sen.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sen_Logo_XL_RGB_White_Bitmap.png",SEN ISS (Raw 4K)
https://spacetv.sen.com/out/v1/058d27c98eb543c987d75d60085b61c7/index/index.m3u8#referer=https://www.sen.com/&origin=https://www.sen.com/&noaudio=true
```

***Method 2: Create a custom streaming profile in Dispatcharr for Video-Only Streams***

The `-noaudio` argument can be supplied to dispatchwrapparr as a custom profile for video-only streams.

Note: Using the novideo and noaudio arguments either as a fragment or a cli argument will disable the stream variant detection.
